## Description
Merge two given sorted ascending integer array A and B into a new sorted integer array.
## Example
### Example 1:
Input:
<pre>
A = [1]
B = [1]
</pre>
Output:
<pre>
[1,1]
</pre>
Explanation:

return array merged.
### Example 2:
Input:
<pre>
A = [1,2,3,4]
B = [2,4,5,6]
</pre>
Output:
<pre>
[1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6]
</pre>
## Challenge
How can you optimize your algorithm if one array is very large and the other is very small?
